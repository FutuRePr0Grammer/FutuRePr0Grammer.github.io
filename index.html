    <!---about me paragraph-->
    <p>Hello, my name is David Rochon, and I am a computer science student at Bridgewater University!
        I am currently in my Junior year at BSU, although I did not complete my previous two years 
        of college at BSU; I actually graduated Summa Cum Laude with my Associate's in 
        Computer Information Systems in the Spring of 2021. When I am not coding or doing homework, I 
        am attempting to learn the guitar, listening to music, reading, or enjoying time with my lovely 
        fiancee Erica (she is also a programmer who graduated from BSU) and my great friend Zac.
